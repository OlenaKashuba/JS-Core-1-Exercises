/* Challenge 3: Needle in a Haystack

Can you find the needle in the haystack?

Write a function `findNeedle()` that takes an array full of junk but containing one "needle", which you need to find with a for loop.

After your function finds the needle it should return a message (as a string) that says: `"Found the needle at position x"`, with `x` being the index number at which you find the needle.

So:

var haystack = ['hay', 'rabbit', 'needle', 'hat'];

findNeedle(haystack);

Should return:

'Found the needle at position 2'
*/

var haystack = ['hay', 'rabbit', 'needle', 'hat'];

function findNeedle(haystack) {
	for (var i=0; i < haystack.length; i++) {
		if (haystack[i] === 'needle') {
			return ('Found the needle at position ' + [i]);
		}
	}
}

console.log(findNeedle(haystack));
